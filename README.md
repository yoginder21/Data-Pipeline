# Data-Pipeline
The dataset comprises diverse demographic and health indicators, including birth and death rates, fertility, migration, and life expectancy trends across various countries. The process of managing this data involves a sophisticated Data pipeline, beginning with the extraction of specific data points using SQL queries within Google BigQuery. This step ensures efficient and relevant data retrieval from a larger database. Following extraction, the dataset is imported into Google Colab, a cloud-based environment, for exploratory data analysis and cleaning. This stage is crucial for maintaining data integrity and involves addressing missing values, outliers, and potential inaccuracies. The cleaned and analyzed data is then exported to Power BI, where advanced visualization techniques are utilized to create a professional and comprehensive dashboard. This dashboard effectively illustrates key insights through interactive visual elements, making complex demographic patterns and health trends accessible and understandable. The integration of BigQuery, Google Colab, and Power BI in this pipeline underscores a robust approach to data-driven decision-making and insightful analysis.
